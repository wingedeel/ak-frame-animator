# ak-frame-animator

# Aim:
# 1.  	Parent component will look at the properties set on its Child
# 		(e.g. fileroot, start-frame, end-frame, zero-padding)
# 2.	Will create a counter by looping through each number between 
#		start-frame and end-frame returning to 0 after the end-frame
# 3.	Will send that number to the Child component
# 4.	Child component will then establish which file to display
#		and display it
